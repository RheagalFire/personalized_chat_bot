# Personalized Chat Bot

This project is an innovative approach to create a personalized bot using your WhatsApp data. We utilize Pinecone, Langchain, and OpenAI services to achieve a more individualized user interaction experience.

## <u>Description</u>
This project aims to create a personalized bot that can simulate a user's messaging style using their WhatsApp data. The bot can be used for various purposes such as automating responses, mimicking a user's texting style, or creating a digital avatar.

We use the following services:

- **WhatsApp as a data source** : We use your exported WhatsApp chat data as the base for creating the bot's personality.<br>
- **Pinecone**: A vector database used for similarity search, personalization, and machine learning. In this project, Pinecone is used to create and manage the vector representations of the WhatsApp messages.<br>
- **Langchain**: LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models<br>
- **OpenAI**: We use OpenAI's GPT model to generate responses that simulate a user's personal messaging style.

There is clear demonstration for every step that was carried out in the notebooks provided.

## <u> Local Setup</u>
```
git clone https://github.com/RheagalFire/personalized_chat_bot.git 
```

Put your OPENAI_API_KEY and PINECONE_KEY in the .env file. (create a .env file)

```
docker build -t container_name .
```

```
docker run -p 8501:8501 container_name:tag
```

Your app would run in localhost:8501
